Got it ‚Äî since it's a **low-level, basic tool** and currently in **Alpha**, the README should reflect its **early-stage, experimental nature** with a focus on what it *can* do right now, rather than projecting too many polished features. Here's a simplified and honest version:

---

# PhoenixRoseMedia DNS Manager (Alpha)

**PhoenixRoseMedia DNS Manager** is a lightweight, low-level DNS record manager currently in **Alpha**. It provides basic tools for editing and managing DNS zones and records via a local or CLI-based interface. This tool is intended for experimentation, testing, and foundational DNS automation work.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: Alpha

This is a work-in-progress and **not ready for production use**. Breaking changes and incomplete features should be expected. Use with caution and test thoroughly.

---

## ‚ú® Current Features

* Basic DNS zone file reading and writing
* Simple add/update/remove support for A, CNAME, and TXT records
* Local-only file operations (no network sync yet)
* Minimal CLI interface for record manipulation
* No external dependencies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Python 3.10+ (or insert your language/runtime)
* Basic understanding of DNS zone files
* Linux/macOS recommended (Windows support not tested)

---
